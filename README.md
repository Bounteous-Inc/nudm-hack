* [Suggestions?](#suggestions) [What are those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H89WkFUG2U)?!
* [Huh? Can someone please define what is a Volunteer/Opportunity Recommendation?](#glossary)

## <a name="intro">**Okay, I signed up for this, now what?**
 
Congratulations! You’re already off to a good start by reading these guidelines. Next, let's set the vibe for the challenge. We have provided many tools to help guide your progress during the event. However, it is only a guide. Feel free to stray from anything we have provided and come up with solutions even better than we could have imagined. The only real requirement is to build something that solves any piece of the challenge statement: **match volunteers with organizations and vice versa**. Oh, and more importantly, to have fun!
 
## <a name="challenge-statement">**What actually is the challenge I am trying to solve?**
 
NUDM raises money for tons of different charitable organizations. Can you guess what goes hand in hand with charitable organizations? VOLUNTEERING! This challenge is a chance for you to help **match volunteers with organizations and vice versa**. Who knows, maybe during the process you’ll find some awesome organization to get involved with.
 
Evanston Community Foundation -- cool kids call it ECF -- is a huge resource to the Evanston community. ECF connects different organizations throughout the community, helping the community help one another. Currently they use the city of Evanston volunteer [site](https://volunteerevanston.galaxydigital.com/need/) to match volunteers to opportunities, but perhaps it could be done even better. Here is your opportunity to generate a solution that solves what the existing site solves and more. Listed in no particular order are some ideas to get you started — _and remember, don’t be afraid to color outside the lines_:


* View, search, filter, and sort volunteer opportunities
* View, search, filter, and sort agencies
* Recommend volunteer opportunities based on user’s profile to volunteers
* Recommend volunteers based on user’s profile to agencies
* Manage opportunities including search criteria (**C**reate**R**ead**U**pdate**De**lete)
* Manage agency profile (CRUD)
* Manage volunteer profile (CRUD)
* Anything else you think would be awesome!!!
## <a name="suggestions">**Suggestions? [What are those](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H89WkFUG2U)?!**
 
The above-mentioned list is a summary of our suggestions, but for our real suggestions, please see the suggestions document. You can view this excel sheet by downloading the repository and opening suggestions.xslx. It is not expected that all (or even any) of the suggestions will get done, as they are in no particular order, but f you choose to solve the challenge of **match volunteers with organizations and vice versa**, in some other way, go at it! It will be more impressive if you get a few things done really well, rather than trying to do it all. However, if you can get it all done, and do it well then that’s cool too. Just make sure you follow our number one rule, HAVE FUN!
 
Another thing to keep in mind besides having fun is to keep the ‘tech challenge' mentality. This means the things you learn in school about security, complete features, and edge cases - erase from your mind. No need to consider those or things like login unless you really want to handle it. 


## <a name="glossary">**Huh? Can someone please define what is a Volunteer/Opportunity Recommendation?**

Assuming you took a look at the suggestions document, you may have some questions on what all those things mean. Sit back relax, we have provided a glossary.  

* **Volunteer:** Either an individual or group who wants to donate their time/skills to help, given an opportunity. An example of a group could be, students from a marketing class that can help a small business with their branding needs. Or a group from the Greek system looking to do some philanthropy. An example of an individual, is you! A volunteer may want to focus their chosen activities to a specific interests and or cause.

* **Agency:** An organization that potentially or currently has opportunities for a volunteer(s) to help. Agencies are associated to different causes.

* **Opportunity:** A need where some helping hands are needed. Could be a one time event, an ongoing need, an event with multiple shifts, a direct service (building a company web app), or a thought. Opportunities are associated to different interests.

* **Volunteer Service Donation:** Volunteer posting that they have some skill they are will to donate. For example, I am a volunteer (individual or group) and we are skilled in dog walking. So, feel free to contact us if you could use some dog - walking services. 

* **Agency Profile:** Details about the agency. Answers such questions as: What are they about? Where are they located? How do I contact them? What causes do they support? What volunteer opportunities are currently posted?

* **Volunteer Profile:** Details about the volunteer. Answers such questions as: Are they an individual or group? What age group do they fall in? Where are they located? What are their interests? What causes are they interested in?  

* **Volunteer/Opportunity Recommendations:** *This may be a really awesome piece of the challenge solution*. This is one of two things. It can be a list of opportunities suggested to a volunteer based on matching the opportunity’s details to the volunteer’s details. Or, it can be a list of volunteers that can be suggested to an agency based on matching the volunteer’s details to the opportunity’s details. 

## <a name="setup">**Um, how do I get my environment set up? And what about data?**

Okay, so now that you have the basic guidelines down, it’s time to get started! You are free to do this in your own environment, but for those who would like a kick start, we have provided a Java starter. It is located [here](./setup.md). It also includes detailed instructions as well as a script to build your database and load your data. 

## **Again, and what about data?**

The database and data is there for you to help get started. Feel free to use as is, change in any way you choose, or not use it at all.

## <a name="how-to-submit">**How do I win? What do I win? Am I going to Disney World?**

We saved the important details for last! And these details are ones you need to follow. So get your erasers and don’t color outside the lines here.  

On Friday at 7 a.m., your tech challenge project is due. Your final project should include a 5-min demo of your project and your code. The code can be a link to your git repository or a zipfile. Make sure to also include a little information about the members of your team, including year in the program and anything else you would like for us to know about you. This should all be emailed to nudmtechchallenge@hs2solututions.com. When is it due? Friday, March 2nd, 7 a.m. CST! The HS2 judges will then review the entries. By 10 a.m., we will notify the three finalists. On Friday from, 2 p.m. - 4 p.m., top finalists will present at the Norris University Center for Final Presentations. Presentations will be timed with a 10 minute cut-off. Winning team will be chosen by peers and judges. So peers, make sure to bring a connected device so you can participate in the vote!

The first round of judging for the three finalists will be judged on the following:

* Creativity of solution
* Completeness of functionality
* User experience
* Insight (well thought out solution)
* Ingenuity
* Team experience (is your team mainly newbies, or soon to be graduates?)

## **What does the winning team win?**

The winning team will win bragging rights, awesome HS2 swag, and a total of $2,000 towards their NUDM fundraising goal!

## **Am I going to Disney World?**

Um, we have no idea, don’t have access to your calendar. Maybe ask your mom and dad?

## **That’s everything, now get Hacking!**
